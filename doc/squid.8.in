.SH DESCRIPTION
.B squid
is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, ICAP, ICP, HTCP and HTTP data objects.
Unlike traditional caching software, 
.B squid
handles all requests in a single, non-blocking process.
.PP
.B squid
keeps meta data and especially hot objects cached in RAM, 
caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking DNS lookups, and implements
negative caching of failed requests.
.PP
.B squid
supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging. 
By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocols ICP, HTCP or CARP, 
.B squid 
caches can be arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional 
bandwidth savings.
.PP
.B squid
consists of a main server program squid, some optional programs for 
custom processing and authentication, and some management and client
tools.  When squid starts up, it spawns a configurable number of
helper processes, each of which can perform parallel lookups.
This reduces the amount of time the cache waits for results.
.PP
.B squid
is derived from the ARPA-funded Harvest Project 
http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/
.PP
This manual page only lists the command line arguments.  For details
on how to configure

see the file 
.BI @DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@.documented,
the Squid wiki FAQ and examples at
